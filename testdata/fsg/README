The generator produces a set of simple graphs (no loops and no
multiple edges) to the standard output.  Both edges and vertices may
be labeled.  If you execute the command without any arguments, it will
show the list of options.  For example, the next line will produce
10000 graph transactions to the standard output:

    ./ggen -D10000 -L200 -E40 -V40 -i6 -T10 -S

The meaning of those options are shown below (in general, those
options should correspond to the notation appeared in my ICDM'01 paper
and technical report 02-026, 2002):

    -D N    produce N transactions
    -E N    use N distinct edge labels
    -i N    the average size of frequent patterns (c.f. -L)
    -L N    use N frequent patterns as possible frequent graphs
    -S      put frequent patterns as much as possible into each 
            transaction by overlapping them.  Without this option, the
            resulting transactions would contain fewer number of
            frequent patterns specified with the -L and -i options 
            in them.
    -T N    the average transaction size
    -V N    use N distinct vertex labels
    -s N    use N as the seed for the pseudo-random number generator.

The output format is described in the PAFI manual available from
