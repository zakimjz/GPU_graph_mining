\section{Discussion}

The most important parallel operations for our algorithm are: 1)
parallel scan; 2) parallel \emph{segmented} scan; 3) parallel
reduction; 4) parallel \emph{segmented} reduction. These operations
heavily influences the speedup of the GPU implementation as there is a
lot of \emph{administration} behind the algorithm.
