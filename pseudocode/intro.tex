\section{Introduction}

Frequent pattern mining citations: \cite{agrawal94fast},
\cite{han00mining}, \cite{zaki97newalgorithms}.

The frequent graph mining has received a lot of attention in the past
years as it has many practical applications. Unfortunatelly, frequent
graph mining is computationally very expensive. Therefore it is
important to design parallel algorithms for the task.

In the past years the general purpose graphical processing units
(GPGPU) are emerging as cheap and relatively powerful computational
architecture. Therefore, it is important to design new algorithms for
these architectures. Not all algorithms are suitable for this kind of
architecture. 

In this paper we present a GPGPU parallelization of the GSpan
algorithm. In fact, we show just how to replace particular operations
in the algorithm by their GPGPU counterparts.

The first sequential graph mining algorithm was introduced in
\cite{kuramochi2001frequent}. The algorithm in
\cite{kuramochi2001frequent} is Apriori-based algorithm.

Another frequent graph mining papers: \cite{gspan}.
